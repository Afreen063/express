    Construction of the mausoleum was essentially completed in 1643, but work continued on other
     phases of the project for another 10 years.
      The Taj Mahal complex is believed to have been completed in its entiret
      y in 1653 at a cost estimated at the time 
      to be around ₹32 million, which in 2020 would be approxim
      ately ₹70 billion (about US $1 billion). The construction proje
      ct employed some 20,000 artisans under the guidance of a board of architects
       led by the court architect to the emperor, Ustad Ahmad Lahauri. Various t
       ypes of symbolism have been employed in the Taj to reflect natura
       l beauty and divinity.
